# Git-setup-in-linux-
When installing new git in linux, this scripts are useful to set up ssh key generation and setting everything until cloning the repo and initialising the repo folder locally.


Using the script:
1. copy all the files
2. chmod + *.x
3. run ./main.ssh

and follow the steps by the prompted messages to successfully create and clone the working local repo with necessary perimissions.

using these scripts we can switch between multiple github accounts and work with different repositories without any issues
